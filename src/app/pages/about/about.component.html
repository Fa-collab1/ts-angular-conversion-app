        <h2>Construction and Architecture</h2>
        <p>This application serves to ease the process of converting units between different measurement systems such as
            meters to feet or Celsius to Fahrenheit. Below, I detail the construction of the site, the techniques
            utilized, and the key learnings from my development journey.</p>

        <h2>Key Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Angular Components:</strong> The application's structure is defined by several Angular
                components, including HomeComponent, AboutComponent, ConversionComponent,footerComponent,
                headerComponent, pictureShowComponent and SecretAreaComponent. These components are routed using
                Angular's RouterModule, ensuring seamless navigation and a clear separation of concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Routes:</strong> Our routing setup is defined in a specific routes configuration, which not only
                directs the basic navigation like Home, About, and Conversion pages but also handles redirects and
                errors, pointing to a SecretAreaComponent for any undefined routes.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Binding and Forms:</strong> The ConversionComponent is crucial as it handles the real-time
                conversion logic. Utilizing Angularâ€™s FormsModule, this component allows for two-way data binding of
                user inputs, enabling instant calculation as data is entered or changed.</li>
            <li><strong>Styling with SCSS:</strong> Styling across the application is managed using SCSS for modular and
                scalable CSS management. This includes specific styles for navigation, forms, and the footer, providing
                a cohesive and responsive design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Techniques Employed</h2>
        <p>Key techniques employed in the development of this app include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Component-Based Architecture</li>
            <li>Reactive Forms</li>
            <li>Routing</li>
            <li>Data binding</li>
            <li>SCSS for Design</li>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>This project was not only about implementing functionality but also about my first learning experience with
            Angular. It was not easy to understand at first, but I think it has gotten a little clearer now.</p>
        <p>Publishing to Heroku, with this I failed utterly, but Netlify "just worked instantly", so I chose to go with
            Netlify for this project.</p>
        <p>Developing the Conversion App has been a rewarding journey, pushing the boundaries of my skills in front-end
            development.</p>
        <p>I really do like not having to copy the navigation bar and footer to every single page as we have done
            before. Changes to it used to be such a hazzle.</p>
        <p>It was also really easy to incorporate modules. The modular way of working is really great!</p>
        <p>I'm not quite sure If I have put to much css in the main css file or not though.</p>

        <h2>Development server</h2>
        <p>Run <code>ng serve</code> for a dev server. Navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200/</code>. The application
            will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Code scaffolding</h2>
        <p>Run <code>ng generate component component-name</code> to generate a new component. You can also use
            <code>ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>Run <code>ng build</code> to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the <code>dist/</code>
            directory.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Running unit tests</h2>
        <p>Run <code>ng test</code> to execute the unit tests via <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io">Karma</a>.
            (this I haven't tried)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Running end-to-end tests</h2>
        <p>Run <code>ng e2e</code> to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command,
            you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities. (this I haven't tried)</p>
